# SQL Server Samples Repository (和訳したものです）
This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to use Microsoft's SQL products including SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.

Note that certain features like In-Memory OLTP are edition specific for SQL Server and would be possible to implement if the edition which supports that feature is being used to run the sample. 

## Working in GitHub
To work in GitHub, go to https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples and fork the repository. Work in your own fork and when you are ready to submit to make a change or publish your sample for the first time, submit a pull request into the master branch of sql-server-samples. One of the approvers will review your request and accept or reject the pull request.

Each sample should be in its own folder with a README.md file that follows the [template](README_samples_template.md). Generated files (e.g., .exe or .bacpac) and user configuration settings (e.g., .user) should not be committed to GitHub.
